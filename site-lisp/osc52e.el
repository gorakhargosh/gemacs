;;;; This script can be loaded during emacs initialization to automatically
;;;; send `kill-region' and `kill-ring-save' regions to your system clipboard.
;;;; The OSC 52 terminal escape sequence is used to transfer the selection from
;;;; emacs to the host terminal.

;;;; It is based off of the osc52.el copyright the Chromium OS authors, but
;;;; was modified to add support for tmux, graphical displays, and
;;;; multi-byte strings.

;;;; It works in hterm, xterm, and other terminal emulators which support the
;;;; sequence.

;;;; It also works under screen, via `osc52-select-text-dcs' and tmux via
;;;; `osc52-select-text-tmux', as long as the terminal supports OSC 52.

;;;; Call `osc52-set-cut-function' to activate.

The OSC 52 sequence requires a terminator byte.  Some terminals will ignore or
mistreat a terminated sequence that is longer than a certain size, usually to
protect users from runaway sequences.

This variable allows you to tweak the maximum number of bytes that will be sent
using the OSC 52 sequence.

If you select a region larger than this size, it won't be copied to your system
clipboard.  Since clipboard data is base 64 encoded, the actual number of
characters that can be copied is 1/3 of this value.")
