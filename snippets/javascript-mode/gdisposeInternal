  // (1) Dispose of all goog.Disposable objects owned by this class.
  // IMPORTANT: DONT dispose goog.Disposable objects NOT owned by this
  // class. An object is owned by this class if this class created it.
  // An object passed to this class that was created by another class
  // should NOT be disposed here.
  // goog.dispose(this.someDisposable);

  // (2) Remove listeners added by this class.
  // Ideally, you would use an EventHandler class that removes the
  // need to manually dispose event listeners like this.
  // this.container.removeEventListener('mouseover',
  //                                    this.eventListener,
  //                                    false);

  // (3) Remove references to COM objects.
  // this.xhr_ = null;       // set nullables to null.

  // (4) Remove references to DOM nodes, which are COM objects in IE.
  // delete this.container;  // delete non-nullables.
  // this.label = null;      // set nullables to null.

  // Don't forget to breathe!
